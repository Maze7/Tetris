# GameCollection
Firstly this project was designed to be a Tetris Remake in C++ for one of our University exams. 
We expand it to a little GameCollection. 

The main "feature" is still Tetris but we programmed Snake and FlappyBird as well. 

You can add your own games to it, see following explanation.

## Build 
```
git clone https://github.com/Maze7/Tetris
(cd [...])
chmod +x autogen.sh && ./autogen.sh
make all
```
